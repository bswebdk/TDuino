  * If _buffered_ is true, _samples_ readings from the pin will be stored in a buffer
  * (BEWARE: dynamic memory usage!) in order to calculate an average reading for the
  * event. This means that the value passed to the event is an average of one new
  * reading combined with _samples_-1 old readings.
  * 
  * If any debounce is defined for the pin, the debounce will be the minimum amount
  * of time there has to elapse between each sample. For non-buffered sampling, the
