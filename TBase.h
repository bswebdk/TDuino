 * \brief Base class for all classes in TDuino.
 * 
 * Used as a base class for all classes in TDuino. If you want to extend TDuino
 * with extra classes you should use TBase as a base class for your new classes.
 *
 * TBase is only intended as a "common root" and cannot be instantiated.
 * 
 * A minimal, valid subclass of TBase class would look something like this:
 * 
 * \code
 * // Header
 * TMyClass : public TBase
 * {
 *   ...
 * public:
 *   virtual void loop();
 * };
 * 
 * // Source
 * void TMyClass::loop()
 * {
 *   TBase::loop(); // Call loop of base class
 * 
 *   // Your own loop code goes here and you should use the protected
 *   // field "loopMillis" for timing.
 * }
 * 
 * \endcode

   * \brief Method used to reset all class internal variables.

   * Implemented to avoid inheritance issues when overriding constructors who needs
   * to change the default values of their parent classes. Instead of overriding a
   * constructor like this:
   * 
   * \code
   * TMyClass::TMyClass() : TBase()
   * {
   *   this->some_value = 0;
   * }
   * \endcode
   * 
   * You should override defaults() and call it in your constructor like this:
   * 
   * \code
   * TMyClass::defaults()
   * {
   *   TBase::defaults();
   *   this->some_value = 0;
   * }
   * 
   * TMyClass::TMyClass()
   * {
   *   defaults();
   * }
   * \endcode
   * 
   * Doing it this way will ensure that all class internal variables are
   * initialized to their default values in the right order. It will also
   * allow any child classes to modify the default values of their parents
   * in the construction phase.
