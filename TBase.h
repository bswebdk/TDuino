/**
 * \brief Base class for all classes in TDuino.
 * 
 * Used as a base class for all classes in TDuino. If you want to extend TDuino
 * with extra classes you should use TBase as a base class for your new classes.
 *
 * TBase is only intended as a "common root" and cannot be instantiated.
 * 
 * A minimal, valid subclass of TBase class would look something like this:
 * 
 * \code
 * // Header
 * TMyClass : public TBase
 * {
 *   ...
 * public:
 *   virtual void loop();
 *   virtual void setup();
 * };
 * 
 * // Source
 * void TMyClass::loop()
 * {
 *   TBase::loop(); // Call loop of base class
 * 
 *   // Your own loop code goes here and you should use the protected
 *   // field "loopMillis" for timing.
 * }
 * 
 * void TMyClass::setup()
 * {
 *   // Do not call TBase::setup() - it does not exist
 * 
 *   // Your own setup code goes here.
 * }
 * \endcode
