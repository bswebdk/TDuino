/**
 * \brief Used for timing a callback method.

 * TTimer is used to perform timed operations using a callback method. It is possible to
 * have up to 255 timed operations (if memory allows it) using one TTimer instance. All
 * operations use the same callback method and passes the index of the timer operation
 * to the callback.
 *

 * void timerCallback(byte timerIndex)
 * {
 *   // "timerIndex" is the index of the timer slot.
 *   if (timerIndex == 0)
 *   {
 *     //Do something every 500 milliseconds
 *   }
 *   else if (timerIndex == 1)
 *   {
 *     //Do something every 1000 milliseconds
 *   }
 * }
