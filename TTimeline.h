 * These functions will help you to convert the progress value passed to
 * the timeline callback to numeric values of different types. All functions
 * takes these three arguments:
 * 
 * \b progress The float passed to the callback.
 * \b min The minimum value it should be mapped to.
 * \b max The maximum value it should be mapped to.
 * 
 * The formula is pretty simple: roundf((float)(max - min) * progress) + min
 * 
 * The are functions for signed and unsigned int + long and for float:
 * 
 * \code
 * void TimelineCallback(byte slot, float progress)
 * {
 *   //Map to int value between 1000 and 2000:
 *   int intValue = TL_MapToInt(progress, 1000, 2000);
 * 
 *   //Map to long value between 10000 and 20000:
 *   long longValue = TL_MapToLong(progress, 10000, 20000);
 * 
 *   //Map to float value between 1.5 and 6.5:
 *   float floatValue = TL_MapToFloat(progress, 1.5f, 6.5f);
 * }
 * 
 * TTimeline tline(TimelineCallback, 2);
