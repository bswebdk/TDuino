TDuino is a convenience library for Arduino (and clones). With TDuino you will be able to
quickly implement basic timing features and different pin actions with only a few lines
of code.

## The good :-)
* A lot of code already written
* Simple to use
* Multitasking done simple
* Event driven pin input
* Automatized pin outputs
* Nice debugging features
* NO F'IN DELAYS! <small>(almost.. see TPinInput::read(byte))</small>

## The bad :-(
* Slightly slower execution due to overhead
* Increased code size
* Increased memory usage
